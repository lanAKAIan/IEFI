{"name":"Iefi","tagline":"IEFI - Intelligence Enhancer for Ingress","body":"IEFI - Intelligence Enhancer for Ingress\r\n========================================\r\nA Chrome extension providing enhancements to the Ingress intel site\r\n\r\nNOTE: this project was previously hosted at https://code.google.com/p/intelligence-enhancer-for-ingress/\r\n\r\nThe primry goal of the IEFI project is to provide enhanced functionality to the ingress.com/intel site in a way that\r\ndoes not adversely affect Google's Servers, the Ingress Community, and stays in the \"spirit of Ingress.\" The project \r\nbegan as a way to make it easier to navigating to specific intel map views in the hopes it would help with generating\r\nfield reports and checking up on the \"local situation\". Over time some additional tweaks have been added to hopefully\r\nimprove the user experience.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nThe Intelligence Enhancer for Ingress project's primary goal is to help the ingress user community. With this in mind,\r\nenhancements included in the project should meet these criteria:\r\n1. The feature does not negatively impact non-plugin users.\r\n2. The feature would not objectively be considered cheating.\r\n3. The feature's impact to Google and the Ingress Servers is minimal.\r\n\r\n## What the project might do\r\n* Help users in their creation of battle reports by providing an easier map screen-capturing capability.\r\n* Protect classified team information (such as player level) when creating screenshots.\r\n* Allow users to more easily navigate the intel map.\r\n* Increase the usability of the chat system by capturing @user-name messages.\r\n* Provide enhanced filtering capability for the comm system.\r\n\r\n## What the project will not do\r\n* Automatically submitting passcodes on behalf of the user. This would contradict goals 1 and 2 by providing an unfair\r\n  advantage and imbalance between users and non users.\r\n* Track player movement.\r\n\r\n## There is always IITC\r\nJust because a feature is not right for this project does not mean you are out of luck. Those features may already\r\nexist in, or are a good idea for inteligence enhancer for ingress. They can be found over here: \r\nhttps://github.com/jonatkins/ingress-intel-total-conversion\r\n\r\n## How can I help?\r\nThis project is for the ingress community and with any luck by the ingress community. If a feature would be helpful\r\nto you, it likely would be helpful to others. Consider submitting a feature request. If you are a developer,\r\nconsider joining the project.\r\n","google":"UA-37885642-4","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
