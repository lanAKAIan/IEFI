THERE IS CURRENTLY A KNOWN ISSUE
in which the ingress page will get stuck at "Loading Data..." and will not paint any of the map or the chatlog. 
This only appears to happen once per session.

If this happens, just hit reload on the page should fix the issue. It is an issue I have been working against.
========================================================

Provides additional functionality for Google's Ingress Intel Map, without adversely affecting Google's Servers.
Official release channel of http://code.google.com/p/intelligence-enhancer-for-ingress/
1.5.0.22
New Features:
* Added theme capability for the extension, based on the user's faction. Can be overridden in the options page.
* Added some comm adjustment options(off by default) including:
 . Ability to turn off portal addresses in the chatlog.
 . Bertram Simon's comm readability CSS improvements.
* Added a "Developer Options" section which will be a place to contain some settings that may or may not stay. The real reason was to make things easier on me.
 . A theme option with Bertram Simon's WWII bombing map and a tweaked version of the bombing map using inverted sepia. These are just kinda fun, not necessarily useful.
 . force incompatability option - truly a developer setting

Bug Fixes:
* cleaning up the code structure a bit for stability improvements including
* added missing listener removal for screenshot CSS.
* modified the load order of extension components and refactored to remove some dependencies.

1.4.4.0
* Compatibility update for dashboard update on 06/10/13 in order to remove the harassment... functionality did not break.
* Fixed a bug in which when setting the default chat mode to "All" the tab would still visually appear to be "Faction". The mode on the actual chat content was correct however.
