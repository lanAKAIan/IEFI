THERE IS CURRENTLY A KNOWN ISSUE
in which the ingress page will get stuck at "Loading Data..." and will not paint any of the map or the chatlog. 
This only appears to happen once per session.

If this happens, just hit reload on the page should fix the issue. It is an issue I have been working against.
