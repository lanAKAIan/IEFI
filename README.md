==== IEFI - Intelligence Enhancer for Ingress ====
A Chrome extension providing enhancements to the Ingress intel site

NOTE: this project was previously hosted at https://code.google.com/p/intelligence-enhancer-for-ingress/

The primry goal of the IEFI project is to provide enhanced functionality to the ingress.com/intel site in a way that
does not adversely affect Google's Servers, the Ingress Community, and stays in the "spirit of Ingress." The project 
began as a way to make it easier to navigating to specific intel map views in the hopes it would help with generating
field reports and checking up on the "local situation". Over time some additional tweaks have been added to hopefully
improve the user experience.

Introduction:
The Intelligence Enhancer for Ingress project's primary goal is to help the ingress user community. With this in mind,
enhancements included in the project should meet these criteria:
1. The feature does not negatively impact non-plugin users.
2. The feature would not objectively be considered cheating.
3. The feature's impact to Google and the Ingress Servers is minimal.

What the project might do:
* Help users in their creation of battle reports by providing an easier map screen-capturing capability.
* Protect classified team information (such as player level) when creating screenshots.
* Allow users to more easily navigate the intel map.
* Increase the usability of the chat system by capturing @user-name messages.
* Provide enhanced filtering capability for the comm system.

What the project will not do:
* Automatically submitting passcodes on behalf of the user. This would contradict goals 1 and 2 by providing an unfair
  advantage and imbalance between users and non users.
* Track player movement.

How can I help?
This project is for the ingress community and with any luck by the ingress community. If a feature would be helpful
to you, it likely would be helpful to others. Consider submitting a feature request. If you are a developer,
consider joining the project.
